*Writing* uses [[https://code.google.com/archive/p/pagedown/][Pagedown]], [[https://github.com/jmcmanus/pagedown-extra][Pagedown Extra]], [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]], StackOverflow's
[[https://gist.github.com/gdalgas/a652bce3a173ddc59f66][editor code]], and the [[http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net/][Computer Modern]] font.

/Note: Some of these libraries have been slightly modified (a few lines
of code), to make it work all together, that's why they are included in
this package./
